    <h1>Cow</h1>
    <p>Cows are domesticated ungulates that are raised for their milk, meat, and hides. They are known for their gentle nature and are often seen grazing in pastures.</p>
    <p>Cows are social animals that live in herds and have a complex social structure. They communicate with each other through vocalizations, body language, and even facial expressions.</p>
    <p>Cows are herbivores, primarily feeding on grass and other vegetation. They   have a unique digestive system with four stomach compartments that allow them to efficiently break down tough plant material.</p>
    <p>Cows play a significant role in agriculture, providing milk, meat, and leather       products. They are also used in some cultures for religious and ceremonial purposes.</p>
