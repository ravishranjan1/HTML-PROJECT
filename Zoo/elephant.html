        <p>
            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and long trunks. They are herbivores and can be found in various habitats including savannas, forests, and grasslands.
            Elephants are known for their complex social structures and strong family ties, often living in matriarchal herds. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to maintain the balance of their habitats.
            Elephants are also known for their impressive memory and problem-solving abilities. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations and body language, and they can recognize themselves in mirrors, a sign of self-awareness.
