        <h1>Panda</h1>
        <p>Pandas are known for their distinctive black and white fur and are native to China. They primarily eat bamboo and are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and low birth rates.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: Pandas can eat up to 38 kilograms (84 pounds) of bamboo every day!</p>
        <p>Scientific Name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca</p>
        <p>Habitat: Mountain ranges in central China, primarily in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.</p>

        <p>Conservation Status: Vulnerable, with efforts ongoing to protect their natural habitat and increase their population through breeding programs.</p>
        <p>Interesting Behavior: Pandas are solitary animals, but they communicate with each other  through vocalizations and scent markings. They are also known for their playful nature, especially when they are young.</p>
        <p>Threats: The main threats to pandas include habitat destruction due to agriculture and logging, as well as climate change affecting bamboo availability.</p>
        <p>Conservation Efforts: Various organizations and the Chinese government are working to protect panda habitats, establish reserves, and promote breeding programs to increase their population.</p>
        <p>Did You Know? Pandas have a special wrist bone that acts like an opposable thumb, allowing them to grasp bamboo stalks effectively.</p>
