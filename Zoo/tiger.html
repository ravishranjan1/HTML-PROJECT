        <h1>Tiger</h1>
        <p>Tigers are the largest cat species in the world, known for their power and strength. They are native to Asia and are easily recognized by their orange coat with black stripes.</p>  
        <p>Scientific Name: Panthera tigris</p>
        <p>Habitat: Tigers primarily inhabit forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are solitary animals and require large territories to hunt and live.</p>
        <p>Diet: Tigers are carnivorous and primarily hunt large prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. They are also known to eat smaller animals when larger prey is scarce.</p>
        <p>Conservation Status: Tigers are classified as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their populations and habitats.</p> 
        <p>Interesting Fact: Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints, which helps researchers identify individual tigers in the wild.</p>  
        <p>Fun Fact: Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in water during hot weather. They can also use water to stalk prey.</p>   
        <p>Threats: The main threats to tigers include habitat destruction, illegal wildlife trade, and conflicts with humans. Conservation organizations are working to mitigate these threats.</p>    
        <p>Conservation Efforts: Various organizations are working to protect tigers through habitat preservation, anti-poaching initiatives, and community education programs. National parks and reserves play a crucial role in tiger conservation.</p>      
        <p>How You Can Help: You can support tiger conservation by donating to wildlife organizations, spreading awareness about the importance of protecting tigers, and advocating for sustainable practices that benefit both wildlife and local communities.</p>    
        <p>Learn More: To learn more about tigers and how you can help, visit the websites of organizations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>        
        <p>Join the Cause: Consider joining local or global conservation efforts to protect tigers and their habitats. Every small action can contribute to the survival of these magnificent creatures.</p>
