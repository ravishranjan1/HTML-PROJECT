        <h1>Wolf</h1>
        <p>Wolves are known for their intelligence and social behavior.</p>
        <p>They live and hunt in packs, which helps them to take down larger prey.</p>
        <p>Wolves communicate through howls, which can be heard over long distances.</p>
        <p>They play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem.</p> 
        <p>Wolves are found in various habitats, including forests, tundras, and grasslands.</p>
        <p>They are primarily carnivorous, but their diet can also include fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Wolves have a strong sense of smell, which they use to track prey    and communicate with each other.</p>
        <p>Conservation efforts are important to protect wolf populations and their habitats.</p>
        <p>Wolves are often misunderstood and portrayed negatively in popular culture.</p>
        <p>They are an essential part of the natural world and contribute to biodiversity.</p>  
        <p>Wolves have a complex social structure, with an alpha pair leading the pack.</p>
