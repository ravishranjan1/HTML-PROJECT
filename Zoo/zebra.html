        <h1>Zebra</h1>
        <p>Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. They are social animals that live in herds and are known for their unique patterns, which help them recognize each other. Zebras primarily graze on grasses and are found in various habitats, including savannas and grasslands.</p>
        <p>These animals are closely related to horses and donkeys, and they exhibit a      wide range of behaviors, including grooming and vocalizations. Zebras are also known for their strong social bonds and protective instincts within their herds.</p>
        <p>In the wild, zebras face threats from predators such as lions and hyenas, but they are also affected by habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts are in place to protect these iconic animals and their habitats.</p> 
        <p>Zebras are fascinating creatures that play a vital role in their ecosystems, and they continue to captivate people with their striking appearance and social behaviors.</p>
